# Advanced-CLI-Calculator-C-
## 📌 Description
This is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator written in C language.  
It supports both basic and advanced mathematical operations, including trigonometric functions.  
This project demonstrates concepts of modular programming, recursion, switch-case, and the use of the C math library.
## Features
- **Basic Operations** → Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- **Advanced Operations** → Power, Factorial (using recursion), Square Root  
- **Trigonometric Operations** → sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) (input in degrees)  
- **Error Handling** → Division by zero, negative factorial/square root
## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C  
- **Libraries:** `<stdio.h>`, `<math.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`  
- **Concepts:** Functions, Recursion, Switch-case, CLI applications
